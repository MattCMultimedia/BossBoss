## Development

### Scraping
Run the scraping scripts from `/lib` with `python -m tasks.latech.courses` and `python -m tasks.latech.classes 20151` (for Fall Quarter 2014)


### @TODO

run this: `select * FROM class WHERE seats_available=0 AND seats_status LIKE "%open%"`, question results

Need to devise a way to default to the most recent term. maybe just parse the dates (Fall 2014) with chronic and get a time


### Use-cases

> I want a class from Trivette this quarter, let's see what he's teaching.

> I'd prefer a class that's in Carson-Taylor so I don't have to run from Davison to GTM.

> I need three more credit-hours, let's see what's still available.
